# California-Housing

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the California Housing dataset using Python to uncover insights into housing prices, demographics, and regional patterns. The notebook focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and identifying key factors that influence median house values across California.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze the distribution and structure of housing-related variables
- Explore how demographics (income, population, age of housing) affect prices
- Identify geographical patterns across California districts
- Visualize trends for clear interpretation
- Demonstrate practical data analytics skills using Python

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (for correlation insights, if applicable)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Higher median income strongly correlates with higher median house values.
- Coastal/urban regions tend to have significantly higher prices than inland areas.
- Population density shows large variation, influencing demand and pricing.
- House age shows mixed impact—location plays a more dominant role.
- Several outliers highlight strong housing price inequality across California.
